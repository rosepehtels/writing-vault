* Removed some unnecessary files and folders. Restructured my folders in a way that makes more sense. I removed some folders I found were uncessary but you can
add them to the vault by downloading version 1.0

* Started working on V3.0 release which includes a new theme, more plugins, and workspaces using the workspaces plugin.
