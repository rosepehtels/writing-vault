# About
This is a copy of my writing vault for obsidian.md. The vault is set-up with themes, plugins and snippets installed and all are included. You may make any changes you find are needed but may not reproduce, resell, or redistribute and claim **as your own**. 

# Installation
## Releases
You can install the vault by selecting the latest release on the main page of the repo and download the latest release. 
Extract the .zip file via an app on your device or automatically on mac then add it to your obsidian folder. open obsidian.md and choose the folder to open as a vault. 

You will recieve a warning regarding the plugins installed. Make sure you agree to use the vault and don't choose the preview option.
